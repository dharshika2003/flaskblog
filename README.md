# flaskblog

worked on developing a web application using Python Flask. The project involved building core modules such as:
      User Authentication: Signup, Login, password handling with Flask-WTF and Flask-Bcrypt.
      User Account Management: Updating username, email, and profile picture.
      Content Management (CRUD): Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on user posts using Flask-SQLAlchemy.


Features: 
            User Authentication:
                  Signup & Login functionality
                  Secure password hashing with Flask-Bcrypt
                  Email validation using email-validator
            User Account Management:
                  Update username, email, and profile picture
                  Profile picture processing with Pillow (PIL)
            Content Management System (CMS):
                  Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) posts
                  Database integration with Flask-SQLAlchemy
            Frontend:
                  Templates rendered with Jinja2
                  Responsive design using HTML/CSS

Tech Stack :
      Backend: Python, Flask
      Frontend: HTML, CSS
      Database: SQLite/MySQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
      Security: Flask-Bcrypt, Flask-WTF for form handling
      Libraries/Extensions:
            flask
            flask-sqlalchemy
            flask-wtf
            flask-bcrypt
            flask-login
            pillow
            email-validator

Skills Gained:
            Web application development with Python Flask
            Database design and ORM integration
            Authentication & authorization mechanisms
            CRUD operations in a web environment
