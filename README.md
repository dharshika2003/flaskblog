# flaskblog

worked on developing a web application using Python Flask. The project involved building core modules such as:
      User Authentication: Signup, Login, password handling with Flask-WTF and Flask-Bcrypt.
      User Account Management: Updating username, email, and profile picture.
      Content Management (CRUD): Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on user posts using Flask-SQLAlchemy.

Technologies & Tools Used:
      Backend: Python Flask (routing, templates, forms, extensions)
      Frontend: HTML, CSS
      Database: SQLite/MySQL (via SQLAlchemy ORM)
      Security: Flask-Bcrypt for password hashing
      Validation: Flask-WTF with email_validator
      Image Handling: Pillow (PIL) for profile pictures

Skills Acquired:
      Flask framework (blueprints, Jinja2 templates, form handling)
      ORM-based database design and queries
      Authentication and authorization mechanisms
      Debugging and performance optimization
      Collaborative development and project management

This hands-on experience strengthened my expertise in Python web development, database integration, and secure authentication systems, preparing me for future work in full-stack web application development.
